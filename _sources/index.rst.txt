Welcome to ``apcac`` documentation!

.. warning::

   This project is under active development.

**APCAC** (Áreas Prioritárias para Conservação de Água, or Priority Areas for Water Conservation)
is a methodology designed to identify and classify priority areas for water conservation in
the Cerrado biome, a large savanna in central Brazil. Using GIS at multiple spatial scales,
the method produces maps that classify catchments into up to 16 priority classes, tailored
to specific actions: natural catchments receive conservation-focused measures, while anthropic
catchments are addressed with risk-mitigation strategies.

This repository provides Python scripts for the QGIS environment, ensuring the method is
reproducible and adaptable for new land use maps, updated data, or future climate change scenarios.
