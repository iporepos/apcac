**APCAC** (Áreas Prioritárias para Conservação de Água, or Priority Areas for Water Conservation)
is a methodology designed to identify and classify priority areas for water conservation in
the Cerrado biome, a large savanna in central Brazil.

Using GIS at multiple spatial scales, the method produces maps that classify catchments into
up to 16 priority classes, tailored to specific actions: natural catchments receive
conservation-focused measures, while anthropic catchments are addressed with risk-mitigation strategies.

This repository provides Python scripts for the QGIS Python environment, ensuring the method is
reproducible and adaptable for new land use maps, updated data, or future climate change scenarios.
